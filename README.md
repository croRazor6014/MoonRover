## ICE coding challenge

There are two parts:
- the implementation is located in in the src folder;
- the corresponding presentation is located in the presentation folder.


## REST API
The task at hand requires 4 main API calls:

</p>

<p align="left">
<img src="presentation/images/turn.PNG" width="887" height="72" border="10"/>
</p>

</p>

<p align="left">
<img src="presentation/images/report.PNG" width="890" height="75" border="10"/>
</p>

The methodologies and reasoning of the implementation 
is explained in more detail in the presentation (e.g. error handling).

## Code Coverage
The solution also includes integration tests that verify and document the usage of the application. <br>
The level of the coverage is the following:
